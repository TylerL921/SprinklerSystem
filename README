Sprinkler System Project

Goal:
The goal of this project is to gather weather data in the area to adjust our sprinklers accordingly.
We achive this by gathering weather data from the OpenMeteo API, storing relevant information into our own database
and sending instructions to our sprinkler system.

Logs:
April 11 2025: 
The data gathering script can now gather weather data from OpenMeteo, format it for Postgres Database, and store information.
