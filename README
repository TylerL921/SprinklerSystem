Sprinkler System Project

Goal:
The goal of this project is to gather weather data in the area to adjust our sprinklers accordingly.
We achive this by gathering weather data from the OpenMeteo API, storing relevant information into our own database
and sending instructions to our sprinkler system.

Dev Notes:
The current system is calibrated to our home's specific needs. Future implementations will be more modular.

Logs:
