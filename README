Sprinkler System Project

Goal:
The goal of this project is to gather weather data in the area to adjust our sprinklers accordingly.
We achive this by gathering weather data from the OpenMeteo API, storing relevant information into our own database
and sending instructions to our sprinkler system.

Dev Notes:
The current system is calibrated to our home's specific needs. Future implementations will be more modular.


Database Breakdown:

Daily Table:
time - co-primary key - timestamp - (timestamp with time zone)
tag - co-primary key - what is being measured - (text)
value - value of tag being measured - (double precision)

Hourly Table:
time - co-primary key - timestamp - (timestamp with time zone)
tag - co-primary key - what is being measured - (text)
value - value of tag being measured - (double precision)

SprinklerLogs Table:
time - primary key - timestamp - (timestamp with timezone)
precipitation - estimated precipitation for the day - (double precision)
runtime - how long was the sprinkler on in minuites - (integer)

Logs:
April 11 2025: 
The data gathering script can now gather weather data from OpenMeteo, format it for Postgres Database, and store information.

June 7 2025:
Added new table into database. Edited code accomodate for the new table. Started to work on being able to log how long the sprinkler system is on.
